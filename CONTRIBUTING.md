# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve this project.

This repository is intended to support an open, transparent, and evidence-informed methodology for analyzing scripts. Contributions from writers, creators, editors, educators, researchers, developers, and other industry participants are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

* Reporting unclear or inconsistent scoring behavior
* Proposing changes to the methodology
* Improving documentation
* Adding evaluation examples
* Adding or improving tests
* Fixing bugs in the reference implementation
* Identifying potential bias or unintended effects
* Improving accessibility or usability
* Reviewing issues and pull requests

You do not need to be a developer to contribute.

## Before Opening an Issue

Please search existing Issues and Discussions before creating a new one.

Use an Issue for:

* A specific scoring inconsistency
* A bug
* A documentation problem
* A concrete methodology proposal
* A request for a new evaluation case

Use Discussions, when enabled, for:

* Open-ended questions
* Early-stage ideas
* Broader industry discussion
* Questions that are not yet ready to become a proposal

## Reporting a Scoring Inconsistency

Please include:

* The methodology version
* The relevant scoring dimension
* The expected result
* The actual result
* A minimal example
* Why the result appears inconsistent
* Whether the issue affects a particular genre, format, language, or writing style

Do not post scripts or excerpts that you do not have permission to share.

## Proposing a Methodology Change

Methodology changes should normally begin as an Issue.

Please include:

* The problem
* The current behavior
* The proposed change
* The reasoning
* Supporting examples or evidence
* Expected effects on existing scores
* Possible drawbacks
* New or updated evaluation cases

A strong proposal explains not only why the new rule may be better, but also where it may fail.

## Pull Requests

Before opening a pull request:

1. Create or reference an Issue for non-trivial changes.
2. Keep the change focused on one problem.
3. Update relevant documentation.
4. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
5. Add evaluation examples when scoring changes.
6. Confirm that automated checks pass.
7. Review your own changes for private or copyrighted material.

Pull requests that alter scoring behavior should clearly state:

* Which scoring rules change
* Why they change
* Which outputs are affected
* Whether existing scores may change
* What evidence or examples support the change
* What tests or evaluation cases were added

## Development Setup

Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
cd REPOSITORY-NAME
```

Create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b descriptive-branch-name
```

Install dependencies using the instructions in the project README.

Run tests before submitting:

```bash
pytest
```

Replace this command if the repository uses a different test runner.

## Branch Names

Use short, descriptive branch names, such as:

```text
docs-clarify-dialogue-score
fix-empty-script-handling
proposal-pacing-calibration
test-genre-edge-cases
```

## Commit Messages

Use clear commit messages that describe the change:

```text
Clarify dialogue scoring thresholds
Add test cases for short scripts
Fix weighting when a dimension is unavailable
```

## Documentation Standards

Documentation should:

* Use plain language
* Define technical terms
* Separate facts from interpretation
* Explain limitations
* Avoid presenting scores as objective artistic truth
* Include examples where useful
* Identify behavior that remains uncertain or disputed

## Evaluation Examples

Evaluation material should be:

* Written for the project
* Public domain
* Licensed for redistribution
* Shared with explicit permission
* Synthetic and clearly labeled as such

Do not contribute unlicensed screenplay excerpts, private workshop material, customer scripts, or confidential submissions.

## Tests

Changes to scoring logic should include tests covering:

* Expected behavior
* Boundary conditions
* Missing information
* Invalid input
* Relevant genre or format differences
* Previously reported regressions

Tests should be understandable enough to serve as examples of the intended methodology.

## Generated or AI-Assisted Contributions

AI-assisted contributions are permitted, but the contributor remains responsible for:

* Accuracy
* Licensing
* Originality
* Privacy
* Security
* Test coverage
* Compliance with project policies

Do not submit generated analysis or examples without reviewing them carefully.

Disclose substantial AI assistance when it materially shaped a methodology proposal, evaluation dataset, or pull request.

## Style

Prefer:

* Small, focused changes
* Clear names
* Simple implementations
* Explicit assumptions
* Comments that explain why
* Tests that demonstrate intended behavior

Avoid:

* Unrelated refactoring
* Large dependency additions without justification
* Hidden scoring behavior
* Unexplained constants
* Changes that cannot be reproduced
* Claims of industry consensus without evidence

## Review Process

A maintainer may:

* Request changes
* Ask for additional examples
* Request stronger evidence
* Ask that a proposal be split into smaller changes
* Reject a change that conflicts with project goals
* Close inactive proposals after reasonable notice

Not every valid idea will be accepted. Some proposals may be useful but outside the project’s scope.
